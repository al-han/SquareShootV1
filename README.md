I sent the code that I had from 11:50 from that video in submisssion. I just had trouble uploading

So there were some issues that I did was not able to do. But I got the most important parts that I wanted it.  There is a center square that is able to shoot down attacking squares that are coming from four
different directions which was the basic concept of what I wanted. But I couldn't finished creating something to keep track of the score. In addition, I was unable to finish put sounds in the game. I was 
hoping that I coud do it really quickly, but I had one or two files that pretty much did everything. I did not organize my files well. I also wanted to put up certain powerup but I wasn't able to.
